1.  **_Practise makes it useful_**
    * This is the most common advice and probably the least followed one as well. In today's world, we love everything to be fast; Be it cars, computers or mobiles. At the same time, our learning is also becoming rapid day by day. We like to just skim through the articles, documentations and videos when we are learning something new. While this is helpful in few cases, deep learning is hardly exercised. And doing actual code practically helps to go deeper. Simply put, do sample projects repeatedly when you learn new tools/frameworks to master them.
2. **_Mistakes are good_**
    * When something new is tried, chances are that there will be some errors, few missed items or may be you are completely in a wrong direction. And believe it or not, this is the right way. Its a sign of growth. It shows that you are growing as a developer. Never let the fear of mistakes stop you from acting. While acquiring knowledge, the more mistakes you make, quicker you become adept at the respective skills. Practise and Mistakes go hand in hand.
3. **_Time tracking earns_**
    * Do you know how many minutes do you take to complete X task? Its very important to measure each of your activities on a day-to-day basis. Only then you can provide estimates for future projects properly. Additionally, more of it is saved as you become aware of facts. Though time tracking brings surprises for everyone when they do it first time, one can work to improve only after actual condition is known. Fruits of this habit are way beyond statistics. In other words, we could say - it is like analytics for business which is necessary to stay on track.
4. **_Energy management for good mood_**
    * A developer's work is completely a mind game. Only a sound mind can effectively achieve desired outcomes. Every one of us experience a flow in work occasionally and wish to have it every time we sit in front of the computer. For that we need to train our mind. Its all about energy. Every decision that you make throughout the day uses the energy and bring fatigue. Be a morning person. All of us have a vibrant mind in the morning time (okay, few exceptions!.. Build a great Morning Routine and energy will flow throughout the day.
5. **_Divide and conquer_**
    * Just like we take our meal 'bite' wise, our assignments also need to be completed in steps. So, whenever a task is to be started, first step would be to break it down into smaller logical pieces and execute them one-by-one. And this is connected with one very important habit - No Multi Tasking. I can't recommend this enough. There would be thousands of articles throwing light on this single term specially. Doing several tasks at a time is a badge of pride for many of us and its one of the biggest barriers for higher productivity.
6. **_Distraction free workspace_**
    * Every now and then, we read articles on the 21st century gadgets distracting us every x minutes. Benefit of technology is that we have easy access to an ocean of knowledge now. Lets make it a boon by improving our focus and concentration. Practical tip would be to keep your phone away while working and turning off all those notifications which break the flow of work frequently. Using good quality headphones or ear plugs for noise cancellation is a no-brainer. There are many techniques like Pomodoro or Getting Things Done which cover these points.
7. **_Take a Break, buddy!_**
    * Now that we have loaded our mind with lots of information and processed so many thoughts, lets talk about breaks. Standing up periodically is required for "office workers" to prevent back aches. And just like your body, mind also needs rest. As we know, muscles do not grow while one is working out at the gym; They get stronger during the relaxation phase instead. Same is true for the brain. Let it repair and restore the parts after a heavy dose of work. In fact, we often get the solutions to our problems during the leisure time.
8. **_Forget office politics_**
    * Finally, this habit is going to take you to higher levels in the long run. Sharing is caring. When 'I' becomes 'We', each person of the group excels gradually. As Ratan Tata put,
    * 'If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together.'
    * Just like savings, working as a team is hard at first and very fruitful eventually. Try that and you will never regret.
    * These are the important points, among others, which can help us achieve our goals. You are welcome to share your tips below in the comments section. Thank you.
